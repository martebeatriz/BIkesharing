# BIkesharing

Using Tableau, we downloaded a CSV from the NY Citi Bike website and analyzed it to determine whether a similar business can be started in Des Moines.

## Results:

The following images were compiled using the data and their interpretations are presented alongside.

## Summary: 

It is my interpretation that people like to use Citi Bikes to commute to and from work. Most people do so within 30 minutes. As long as Des Moinesâ€™s city layout provides individuals with the ability to bike to and from their home and job within that time, people will be inclined to rent bicycles. In addition to a regular commune people also seem inclined to use the bikes on the weekends; albeit less frequently. 

It is also my interpretation that individuals are more inclined to rent bikes if they have a subscription. 

I would be interested in knowing the average age of New York residents, the age of the Citi Bike riders, as well as the average age of the residents of Des Moines. With that data, we would have a better idea of what the potential might be for a program like this in Des Moines.
